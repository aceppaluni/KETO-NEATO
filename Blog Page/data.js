        soak up the egg micture. We then fill them with our favoirte ingredeints such as 
        peanut butter, jelly, maple syrup, ham and swiss, and so much more. My favorite is 
        cream cheese and starberry jam!`,

        of cold butter and then pressed onto our black stone. We love pairing them with all of 
        our favoite toppings such as lettuce, tomato, carmelized onions, and cheese. Our burgers 
        pair well with roasted vegtables or Zuchnni fries.`,

        post: `I know what your thinking, soy sauce and panut butter do NOT mix. I am excited to
        say they THEY DO. We have taken our favorite Thai Dish and turned it into our own. Our 
        recipie perfectly balances both as to not over power the falors. We reccommend using 
        spaghetti tofu noodles as this pairs beautifly with our sauces. Additionally, we enjoy 
        adding in our favorite proteins such as grilled shrimp or chicken`,
